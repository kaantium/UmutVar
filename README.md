After the 2023 Mara≈ü Earthquake, I developed a project to prevent aid trucks from being looted and the recipient of aid from receiving multiple aids unnecessarily. The basis of the project is a database that holds the personality information of the person being helped and the donations delivered. The project was actively used in the earthquake zone. It is written in C# language and .Net Framework platform and Access is used as database manager.
The project is based on functionality and fast delivery due to the emergency situation.

Software Features
* A database that keeps the personal information of the earthquake victims assisted and the data of the aid products
* Database representation
* User-friendly interface with record addition, record deletion and record search panels
